# 🩺 Elite Health – Because Grandma Deserves Better Tech 💻❤️


*A frontend-first healthcare platform built with empathy, code, and a cup of chai.*

## 👵🏽 Project Overview

Let’s face it — hospitals can be confusing, crowded, and not the most comfortable places for our elderly loved ones. **Elite Health** is here to fix that. It’s a sleek, accessible, and heart-first website designed to bring quality medical services straight to the cozy corner of your grandma’s sofa.

Our mission?  
**Make elder care so easy, even your tech-phobic uncle can book a doc!**
